# FitNet
Term 3 Year 10 Assessment Web Application Task

## Project Description - FitNet
Fitnet is a mobile app designed to help users build consistent gym habits by combining intuitive workout tracking with a motivational streak system. Inspired by the popular study app Yeolpumta (YPT), this fitness-focused tracker uses time logging, daily streaks, and personal goal setting to encourage commitment and discipline in training routines.

## Requirements
| **Functional** | **Non-Functional** |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| *Workout Timer Functionality*: The app shall allow users to start, pause, and stop a workout timer to record the duration of each session. | *Performance*: The app should respond to user inputs within 1 second and load logs and history within 3 seconds on average devices.|
| *Exercise Logging System*: Users shall be able to log exercises with details such as name, sets, reps, weight, and optional notes. | *Usability*: The user interface must be intuitive and user-friendly, requiring no more than 5 minutes for a new user to understand the core features.|
| *Login System*: The app shall allow users to create an account, log in securely using email/password or third-party authentication, and access their personal workout data. This allows users to create their own profile and add their friends to work along them. | *Aesthetics*: The app shall feature a clean, modern, and visually engaging interface with a dark and light mode, using a consistent colour scheme and minimalistic design to enhance user experience. |
| *Custom Workout Plans*: Allow users to create and save custom workout routines (e.g. “Push Day”, “Leg Day”) and load them quickly for repeated use. | *Reliability* The app should function consistently with no major crashes and preserve user data even after unexpected shutdowns or loss of internet connection. |

### Bonus Content
1. *Streak Tracking*
The app shall track the number of consecutive days a user logs a workout and display their current streak on the home screen.

2. *Rest Timer / Interval Alerts*
Add a built-in rest timer with vibration/sound alerts between sets, useful for circuit training or timed workouts.

3. *Body Progress Tracking*
Let users log body weight, measurements, or upload progress photos over time, visualised through graphs or a photo timeline.

4. *Motivational Quotes / Reminders*
Display daily motivational fitness quotes or custom reminders (e.g. “Leg day today!”) to boost user consistency.

5. *Voice Input & Control*
Add voice command functionality like “Start workout”, “Log 10 push-ups” or “End session”.

6. *Music Integration*
Connect with Spotify or Apple Music so users can control their workout playlist without leaving the app.

7. *Social Leaderboards*
Introduce a friend system with leaderboards based on total time, streaks, or workout days—like Yeolpumta’s rankings.

8. *Achievement Badges*
Reward users with badges for milestones like “7-day streak”, “First 100 reps logged”, or “First custom plan created”.

9. *Offline Mode*
Allow users to log workouts and use timers even without internet access, syncing when back online.

10. *Exercise Library*
Include an in-app library of exercises with animations or short videos showing proper form for each exercise.
